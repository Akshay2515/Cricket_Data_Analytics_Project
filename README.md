## T20 World Cup Cricket Data Analytics Project
Welcome to my T20 World Cup Cricket Data Analytics project! This project aims to perform comprehensive analyses on T20 World Cup cricket data using Python, Pandas, and Power BI. Below, I outline the steps and methodologies I employed to achieve this.

### Tools and Techniques Used
1. **Bright Data is used for web scraping**
2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation in python pandas**
3. **Data Modeling and building Parameters using DAX**
4. **Build Dashboard in Power BI**

### Project Overview
The T20 World Cup is one of the most exciting cricket tournaments, featuring the best teams from around the world. The goal of this project is to analyze various aspects of the tournament, such as player performance, team statistics, and match outcomes, and to gain insights that can help in selecting the best players and strategies.

### Steps Followed
1. **Understanding the T20 World Cup Data**
Gained an overview of the T20 World Cup, including its format, key statistics, and relevant parameters.
Identified the problem statement and defined the scope of the project.
2. **Data Collection**
Utilized web scraping techniques to collect data from the ESPN Cricinfo website.
Extracted various datasets including player statistics, match results, and team performances.
3. **Data Cleaning and Transformation in Python**
Employed Python and Pandas to clean and preprocess the data.
Handled missing values, standardized formats, and performed necessary transformations to prepare the data for analysis.
4. **Data Transformation in Power Query**
Imported the cleaned data into Power BI.
Further transformed the data using Power Query to optimize it for modeling and analysis.
5. **Data Modeling and Building Parameters using DAX**
Created data models in Power BI to establish relationships between different datasets.
Utilized Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to build parameters and perform complex calculations.
6. **Building Dashboard in Power BI**
Designed and developed interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize the data.
Incorporated various visual elements such as charts, graphs, and tables to present the insights clearly.
7. **Insights and Final Player Selection**
Analyzed the dashboards to extract meaningful insights about player performances, team strengths, and match trends.
Based on these insights, selected the final 11 players who would form the ideal team for the T20 World Cup.

## Power BI Dashboard to find Top Final Players To Play Match
